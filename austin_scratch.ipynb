No coding required.\\n\\nYour _organization_ can host an _instance_ of _Chapter_ under a sub-domain of your website, such as `chapter.sierraclub.org` or `chapter.womenwhocode.org`.\\n\\nAll of an _organization_\\'s user data will remain under their control.\\n\\nOur [Vision statement](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/chapter/wiki/Vision) provides more details on the reasons for _Chapter_.\\n\\n## Terminology\\nTo better communicate and more easily build an API and UI, the current contributors have decided on a collection of terminology to clarify discussions surrounding the Chapter project:\\n\\n| Term          | Definition      | Example  |\\n| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |\\n| _instance_      | a web server deployment of the [\"Chapter\" application](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/chapter/), managed by an _organization_. | a Docker container running on a web host |\\n| _organization_ | a non-profit with multiple _chapters_ | Women Who Code at the sub-domain: `chapter.womenwhocode.org` |\\n| _chapter_      | a container for _events_ and _users_  | Women Who Code - New York City |\\n| _event_ | a meeting with a specific location and time to which _users_ can RSVP | Coffee And Code - BistroOne, New York City, NY - April 9, 2020 |\\n| _user_ | an authenticated _user_ who is authorized based on their _role(s)_ | Sally Gold - SallyG@example.com |\\n| _visitor_ | an non-authenticated web browser session with view-only access to public content | Anonymous Web Browser Client |\\n| _owner_ | the _role_ of a _user_ who can configure the [\"Chapter\" application](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/chapter/) _instance_ and manage _administrators_ for an entire _organization_ | Women Who Code - Global IT |\\n| _administrator_ | the _role_ of a _user_ who can setup and manage _chapters_ and _organizers_ for an _organization_ | Women Who Code - European Administrator |\\n| _organizer_ | the _role_ of a _user_ who can manage a _chapter\\'s_ _events_, RSVPs, communications, and _members_ | Women Who Code - Edinburgh, Local Organizer |\\n| _member_ | the _role_ of a _user_ who can follow and receive notifications from a _chapter_ and RSVP to _events_  | Women Who Code - Edinburgh, Local Member |\\n\\n## Tech Stack\\n\\nWe are planning to use the following tools:\\n\\n* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) / [Apollo server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apollo-server-express) extendable graphql server\\n  * [type-graphql](https://github.com/MichalLytek/type-graphql) Code first graphql schema definition library\\n  * [passport.js](http://www.passportjs.org/) for auth\\n* [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org) with [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/#/) for nice integration with `type-graphql`\\n* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for both client and server-side rendering of the frontend (NextJS is based on [React](https://reactjs.org))\\n  * [Apollo Client 3](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)\\n  * [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html#download-links)\\n  * [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) for components and its built-in `makeStyles` hook and `styled` HOC for custom styling\\n  * Functional Components with [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)\\n* [chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) for writing unit tests.\\n  * [sinon](https://sinonjs.org/)\\n  * [sinon-chai](https://github.com/domenic/sinon-chai)\\n\\n\\nA lot of people know these tools, and they\\'re proven to work well at scale.\\n\\nWe will focus on building an open API first. Then, developers can use the API to build their own mobile clients and voice interface clients.\\n\\n## User Stories\\n\\n### MVP\\nThe [MVP user stories are shown in the MVP Project](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/chapter/projects/1) kanban / cards and as [issues marked with \"MVP\"](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/chapter/labels/MVP).\\n\\n### Post-MVP\\nWe are maintaining a list of post-MVP conversations and user stories using the [\"Roadmap\" tag](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/chapter/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+or+is%3Aclosed+label%3ARoadmap+).\\n\\nQuincy Larson is the project lead. [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) will start \"dogfooding\" the MVP with several of its local study groups.\\n\\nHere\\'s an out-dated example of an app with similar functionality: [The freeCodeCamp Study Group Directory](https://study-group-directory.freecodecamp.org).\\n\\n## UI / UX / Design References\\n- [Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/q7DikyL3N0c4CUWxHNa97i/Chapter-Prototype?node-id=1%3A2&scaling=scale-down)\\n- [User Role Workflows](https://www.figma.com/file/ehgBfxoLKrlSZH0uftD6dA/Chapter-Trial?node-id=0%3A1)\\n- [UI / UX Issues](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/chapter/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AUI%2FUX)\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\n* Please read the [contributing guidelines  and steps needed to setup Chapter locally](CONTRIBUTING.md). We take you from local setup to submitting pull requests.\\n\\n* You should [join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/PXqYtEh) to get connected and follow announcements.\\n\\n\\n##

It is run by a [donor-supported 501(c)(3) nonprofit](https://donate.freecodecamp.org) to help millions of busy adults transition into tech. Our community has already helped more than 10,000 people get their first developer job.\\n\\nOur full-stack web development and machine learning curriculum is completely free and self-paced. We have thousands of interactive coding challenges to help you expand your skills.\\n\\n## Table of Contents\\n\\n- [Certifications](#certifications)\\n- [The Learning Platform](#the-learning-platform)\\n- [Reporting Bugs and Issues](#reporting-bugs-and-issues)\\n- [Reporting Security Issues and Responsible Disclosure](#reporting-security-issues-and-responsible-disclosure)\\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\\n- [Platform, Build and Deployment Status](#platform-build-and-deployment-status)\\n- [License](#license)\\n\\n### Certifications\\n\\nfreeCodeCamp.org offers several free developer certifications. Each of these certifications involves building 5 required web app projects, along with hundreds of optional coding challenges to help you prepare for those projects. We estimate that each certification will take a beginner programmer around 300 hours to earn.\\n\\nEach of these 50 projects in the freeCodeCamp.org curriculum has its own agile user stories and automated tests. These help you build up your project incrementally and ensure you've fulfilled all the user stories before you submit it.\\n\\nYou can pull in these test suites through [freeCodeCamp's CDN](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js). This means you can build these projects on websites like CodePen and Glitch - or even on your local computer's development environment.\\n\\nOnce you’ve earned a certification, you will always have it. You will always be able to link to it from your LinkedIn or résumé. And when your prospective employers or freelance clients click that link, they’ll see a verified certification specific to you.\\n\\nThe one exception to this is if we discover violations of our [Academic Honesty Policy](https://www.freecodecamp.org/academic-honesty). When we catch people unambiguously plagiarizing (submitting other people's code or projects as their own without citation), we do what all rigorous institutions of learning should do - we revoke their certifications and ban those people.\\n\\nHere are our ten core certifications:\\n\\n#### 1.

It\\'s up-to-date and works offline out-of-the-box.\\n\\nDevDocs is made of two pieces: a Ruby scraper that generates the documentation and metadata, and a JavaScript app powered by a small Sinatra app.\\n\\nDevDocs requires Ruby 2.6.x, libcurl, and a JavaScript runtime supported by [ExecJS](https://github.com/rails/execjs#readme) (included in OS X and Windows; [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) on Linux). Once you have these installed, run the following commands:\\n\\n```sh\\ngit clone https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/devdocs.git && cd devdocs\\ngem install bundler\\nbundle install\\nbundle exec thor docs:download --default\\nbundle exec rackup\\n```\\n\\nFinally, point your browser at [localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292) (the first request will take a few seconds to compile the assets). You\\'re all set.\\n\\nThe `thor docs:download` command is used to download pre-generated documentations from DevDocs\\'s servers (e.g. `thor docs:download html css`). You can see the list of available documentations and versions by running `thor docs:list`. To update all downloaded documentations, run `thor docs:download --installed`. To download and install all documentation this project has available, run `thor docs:download --all`.\\n\\n**Note:** there is currently no update mechanism other than `git pull origin master` to update the code and `thor docs:download --installed` to download the latest version of the docs. To stay informed about new releases, be sure to [watch](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/devdocs/subscription) this repository.\\n\\nAlternatively, DevDocs may be started as a Docker container:\\n\\n```sh\\n# First, build the image\\ngit clone https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/devdocs.git && cd devdocs\\ndocker build -t thibaut/devdocs .\\n\\n# Finally, start a DevDocs container (access http://localhost:9292)\\ndocker run --name devdocs -d -p 9292:9292 thibaut/devdocs\\n```\\n\\n## Vision\\n\\nDevDocs aims to make reading and searching reference documentation fast, easy and enjoyable.\\n\\nThe app\\'s main goals are to: keep load times as short as possible; improve the quality, speed, and order of search results; maximize the use of caching and other performance optimizations; maintain a clean and readable user interface; be fully functional offline; support full keyboard navigation; reduce “context switch” by using a consistent typography and design across all documentations; reduce clutter by focusing on a specific category of content (API/reference) and indexing only the minimum useful to most developers.\\n\\n**Note:** DevDocs is neither a programming guide nor a search engine. All our content is pulled from third-party sources and the project doesn\\'t intend to compete with full-text search engines. Its backbone is metadata; each piece of content is identified by a unique, \"obvious\" and short string. Tutorials, guides and other content that don\\'t meet this requirement are outside the scope of the project.\\n\\n## App\\n\\nThe web app is all client-side JavaScript, written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org), and powered by a small [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com)/[Sprockets](https://github.com/rails/sprockets) application. It relies on files generated by the [scraper](#scraper).\\n\\nMany of the code\\'s design decisions were driven by the fact that the app uses XHR to load content directly into the main frame. This includes stripping the original documents of most of their HTML markup (e.g. scripts and stylesheets) to avoid polluting the main frame, and prefixing all CSS class names with an underscore to prevent conflicts.\\n\\nAnother driving factor is performance and the fact that everything happens in the browser. A service worker (which comes with its own set of constraints) and `localStorage` are used to speed up the boot time, while memory consumption is kept in check by allowing the user to pick his/her own set of documentations. The search algorithm is kept simple because it needs to be fast even searching through 100,000 strings.\\n\\nDevDocs being a developer tool, the browser requirements are high:\\n\\n* Recent versions of Firefox, Chrome, or Opera\\n* Safari 11.1+\\n* Edge 17+\\n* iOS 11.3+\\n\\nThis allows the code to take advantage of the latest DOM and HTML5 APIs and make developing DevDocs a lot more fun!\\n\\n## Scraper\\n\\nThe scraper is responsible for generating the documentation and index files (metadata) used by the [app](#app). It\\'s written in Ruby under the `Docs` module.\\n\\nThere are currently two kinds of scrapers: `UrlScraper` which downloads files via HTTP and `FileScraper` which reads them from the local filesystem. They both make copies of HTML documents, recursively following links that match a set of rules and applying all sorts of modifications along the way, in addition to building an index of the files and their metadata. Documents are parsed using [Nokogiri](http://nokogiri.org).\\n\\nModifications made to each document include:\\n\\n* removing content such as the document structure (`<html>`, `<head>`, etc.), comments, empty nodes, etc.\\n* fixing links (e.g. to remove duplicates)\\n* replacing all external (not scraped) URLs with their fully qualified counterpart\\n* replacing all internal (scraped) URLs with their unqualified and relative counterpart\\n* adding content, such as a title and link to the original document\\n* ensuring correct syntax highlighting using [Prism](http://prismjs.com/)\\n\\nThese modifications are applied via a set of filters using the [HTML::Pipeline](https://github.com/jch/html-pipeline) library. Each scraper includes filters specific to itself, one of which is tasked with figuring out the pages\\' metadata.\\n\\nThe end result is a set of normalized HTML partials and two JSON files (index + offline data). Because the index files are loaded separately by the [app](#app) following the user\\'s preferences, the scraper also creates a JSON manifest file containing information about the documentations currently available on the system (such as their name, version, update date, etc.).\\n\\nMore information about [scrapers](./docs/scraper-reference.md) and [filters](./docs/filter-reference.md) is available in the `docs` folder.\\n\\n## Available Commands\\n\\nThe command-line interface uses [Thor](http://whatisthor.com). To see all commands and options, run `thor list` from the project\\'s root.\\n\\n```sh\\n# Server\\nrackup              # Start the server (ctrl+c to stop)\\nrackup --help       # List server options\\n\\n# Docs\\nthor docs:list      # List available documentations\\nthor docs:download  # Download one or more documentations\\nthor docs:manifest  # Create the manifest file used by the app\\nthor docs:generate  # Generate/scrape a documentation\\nthor docs:page      # Generate/scrape a documentation page\\nthor docs:package   # Package a documentation for use with docs:download\\nthor docs:clean     # Delete documentation packages\\n\\n# Console\\nthor console        # Start a REPL\\nthor console:docs   # Start a REPL in the \"Docs\" module\\n\\n# Tests can be run quickly from within the console using the \"test\" command. \\n# Run \"help test\" for usage instructions.\\nthor test:all       # Run all tests\\nthor test:docs      # Run \"Docs\" tests\\nthor test:app       # Run \"App\" tests\\n\\n# Assets\\nthor assets:compile # Compile assets (not required in development mode)\\nthor assets:clean   # Clean old assets\\n```\\n\\nIf multiple versions of Ruby are installed on your system, commands must be run through `bundle exec`.\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nContributions are welcome.

This project provides a feature that will\\ntest _camper project code_.\\n\\nAs such, this project should be seen as more of a feature, than as automated\\ntesting. The feature mostly includes automated testing for the students to\\nrun, but it does have a UI, and the tests do not run against our code.\\n\\nSo how do we make sure this feature, used by millions of campers, actually works\\nin production? The confusing answer is that we need to test this feature, which\\nmeans testing the Camper tests.\\n\\nWe do this by running the Camper project tests (everything in the `src`\\ndirectory) over the example projects. Since the example projects are supposed\\nto be working examples, if the tests do not pass for the example projects, we\\nneed to either fix the tests, or fix the example project that fails.\\n\\nIn most projects you wouldn\\'t test the tests, but in this case, the CodePen\\nCamper Project Tests are a production feature potentially used by millions of\\ncampers, so it is important we don\\'t break that feature.\\n\\nThis is important to understand so I\\'ll repeat it in different words: the tests\\nin the `src` directory of this project are not typical tests used to check our\\nown code before deploying. Quite the opposite, they are a production feature\\nthat is used by students in a live setting to check _their own code_.\\nAs such, it is very important that we don\\'t break those tests.\\n\\nIn order to keep things from being confusing, we refer to everything in the\\n`src` directory as the \"CodePen Project Tests\" or the \"Camper Project Tests\" or\\n\"Testable Projects Tests\". Those tests _are the feature_ we are shipping.\\n\\nOpposite of the above, all of the code that lives in the `test` directory _is_\\nthe typical tests used to check our own code before deploying. We simply call\\nthis code the \"automated testing\". It _tests the feature_ we are shipping.\\n\\nThe automated testing can (and should) be performed locally by you before\\ncreating a PR. The tests also run automatically on Travis CI every time you\\ncreate a PR. A PR that has not passed the Travis CI tests should not be merged.\\n\\nFor all the details about automatically testing this project, please see the\\n[CONTRIBUTING guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).\\n\\n### Credits\\n\\n**This repo did not originally live here. There are several important contributors who contributed code before this project took its current form. So credit where credit is due, to those contributors, and to the other key contributors for this project:**\\n\\n- First and foremost is [@Weezlo](https://github.com/Weezlo), thanks for getting us started! And to [@no-stack-dub-sack](https://github.com/no-stack-dub-sack), [@tchaffee](https://github.com/tchaffee) & [@tbushman](https://github.com/tbushman) for seeing it through the rest of the way!

It should be able to instantiate objects based on different budget categories like *food*, *clothing*, and *entertainment*. When objects are created, they are passed in the name of the category. The class should have an instance variable called `ledger` that is a list. The class should also contain the following methods:\\n\\n* A `deposit` method that accepts an amount and description. If no description is given, it should default to an empty string. The method should append an object to the ledger list in the form of `{\"amount\": amount, \"description\": description}`.\\n* A `withdraw` method that is similar to the `deposit` method, but the amount passed in should be stored in the ledger as a negative number. If there are not enough funds, nothing should be added to the ledger. This method should return `True` if the withdrawal took place, and `False` otherwise.\\n* A `get_balance` method that returns the current balance of the budget category based on the deposits and withdrawals that have occurred.\\n* A `transfer` method that accepts an amount and another budget category as arguments. The method should add a withdrawal with the amount and the description \"Transfer to [Destination Budget Category]\". The method should then add a deposit to the other budget category with the amount and the description \"Transfer from [Source Budget Category]\". If there are not enough funds, nothing should be added to either ledgers. This method should return `True` if the transfer took place, and `False` otherwise.\\n* A `check_funds` method that accepts an amount as an argument. It returns `False` if the amount is greater than the balance of the budget category and returns `True` otherwise. This method should be used by both the `withdraw` method and `transfer` method.\\n\\nWhen the budget object is printed it should display:\\n* A title line of 30 characters where the name of the category is centered in a line of `*` characters.\\n* A list of the items in the ledger. Each line should show the description and amount. The first 23 characters of the description should be displayed, then the amount. The amount should be right aligned, contain two decimal places, and display a maximum of 7 characters.\\n* A line displaying the category total.\\n\\nHere is an example of the output:\\n```\\n*************Food*************\\ninitial deposit        1000.00\\ngroceries               -10.15\\nrestaurant and more foo -15.89\\nTransfer to Clothing    -50.00\\nTotal: 923.96\\n```\\n\\nBesides the `Category` class, create a function (ouside of the class) called `create_spend_chart` that takes a list of categories as an argument. It should return a string that is a bar chart.\\n\\nThe chart should show the percentage spent in each category passed in to the function. The percentage spent should be calculated only with withdrawals and not with deposits. Down the left side of the chart should be labels 0 - 100. The \"bars\" in the bar chart should be made out of the \"o\" character. The height of each bar should be rounded down to the nearest 10. The horizontal line below the bars should go two spaces past the final bar. Each category name should be vertacally below the bar. There should be a title at the top that says \"Percentage spent by category\".\\n\\nThis function will be tested with up to four categories.\\n\\nLook at the example output below very closely and make sure the spacing of the output matches the example exactly.\\n\\n```\\nPercentage spent by category\\n100|          \\n 90|          \\n 80|          \\n 70|          \\n 60| o        \\n 50| o        \\n 40| o        \\n 30| o        \\n 20| o  o     \\n 10| o  o  o  \\n  0| o  o  o  \\n    ----------\\n     F  C  A  \\n     o  l  u  \\n     o  o  t  \\n     d  t  o  \\n        h     \\n        i     \\n        n     \\n        g     \\n```\\n\\nThe unit tests for this project are in `test_module.py`.\\n\\n### Development\\n\\nWrite your code in `budget.py`.

To determine if a person is overweight, first calculate their BMI by dividing their weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters. If that value is > 25 then the person is overweight. Use the value 0 for NOT overweight and the value 1 for overweight.\\n* Normalize data by making 0 always good and 1 always bad. If the value of \\'cholestorol\\' or \\'gluc\\' is 1, make the value 0. If the value is more than 1, make the value 1.\\n* Convert the data into long format and create a chart that shows the value counts of the categorical features using seaborn\\'s `catplot()`. The dataset should be split by \\'Cardio\\' so there is one chart for each \\'cardio\\' value. The chart should look like \"examples/Figure_1.png\".\\n* Clean the data. Filter out the following patient segments that represent incorrect data:\\n  - diastolic pressure is higher then systolic (Keep the correct data with `df[\\'ap_lo\\'] <= df[\\'ap_hi\\'])`)\\n  - height is less than the 2.5th percentile (Keep the correct data with `(df[\\'height\\'] >= df[\\'height\\'].quantile(0.025))`)\\n  - height is more than the 97.5th percentile\\n  - weight is less then the 2.5th percentile\\n  - weight is more than the 97.5th percentile\\n* Create a correlation matrix using the dataset. Plot the correlation matrix using seaborn\\'s `heatmap()`. Mask the upper triangle.

What is the probability that a random draw of 4 balls will contain at least 1 red ball and 2 green balls? While it would be possible to calculate the probability using advanced mathematics, an easier way is to write a program to perform a large number of experiments to estimate an approximate probability.\\n\\nFor this project, you will write a program to determine the approximate probability of drawing certain balls randomly from a hat. \\n\\nFirst, create a `Hat` class in `prob_calculator.py`. The class should take a variable number of arguments that specify the number of balls of each color that are in the hat. For example, a class object could be created in any of these ways:\\n```\\nhat1 = Hat(yellow=3, blue=2, green=6)\\nhat2 = Hat(red=5, orange=4)\\nhat3 = Hat(red=5, orange=4, black=1, blue=0, pink=2, striped=9)\\n```\\n\\nA hat will always be created with at least one ball. The arguments passed into the hat object upon creation should be converted to a `contents` instance variable. `contents` should be a list of strings containing one item for each ball in the hat. Each item in the list should be a color name representing a single ball of that color. For example, if your hat is `{\"red\": 2, \"blue\": 1}`, `contents` should be `[\"red\", \"red\", \"blue\"]`.\\n\\nThe `Hat` class should have a `draw` method that accepts an argument indicating the number of balls to draw from the hat. This method should remove balls at random from `contents` and return those balls as a list of strings. The balls should not go back into the hat during the draw, similar to an urn experiment without replacement. If the number of balls to draw exceeds the available quantity, return all the balls.\\n\\nNext, create an `experiment` function in `prob_calculator.py` (not inside the `Hat` class). This function should accept the following arguments:\\n* `hat`: A hat object containing balls that should be copied inside the function.\\n* `expected_balls`: An object indicating the exact group of balls to attempt to draw from the hat for the experiment. For example, to determine the probability of drawing 2 blue balls and 1 red ball from the hat, set `expected_balls` to `{\"blue\":2, \"red\":1}`.\\n* `num_balls_drawn`: The number of balls to draw out of the hat in each experiment.\\n* `num_experiments`: The number of experiments to perform. (The more experiments performed, the more accurate the approximate probability will be.)\\n\\nThe `experiment` function should return a probability. \\n\\nFor example, let\\'s say that you want to determine the probability of getting at least 2 red balls and 1 green ball when you draw 5 balls from a hat containing 6 black, 4 red, and 3 green. To do this, we perform `N` experiments, count how many times `M` we get at least 2 red balls and 1 green ball, and estimate the probability as `M/N`. Each experiment consists of starting with a hat containing the specified balls, drawing a number of balls, and checking if we got the balls we were attempting to draw.\\n\\nHere is how you would call the `experiment` function based on the example above with 2000 experiments:\\n\\n```\\nhat = Hat(black=6, red=4, green=3)\\nprobability = experiment(hat=hat, \\n                  expected_balls={\"red\":2,\"green\":1},\\n                  num_balls_drawn=5,\\n                  num_experiments=2000)\\n```\\n\\nSince this is based on random draws, the probability will be slightly different each time the code is run.\\n\\n*Hint: Consider using the modules that are already imported at the top of `prob_calculator.py`.*\\n\\n### Development\\n\\nWrite your code in `prob_calculator.py`.

The game can be as simple or complex as you like, as long as all the following user stories are implemented:\\n\\n1. Multiple players can connect to a server and play.\\n1. Each player has an avatar.\\n1. Each player is represented by an object created by the `Player` class in `Player.mjs`.\\n1. At a minimum, each player object should contain a unique `id`, a `score`, and `x` and `y` coordinates representing the player\\'s current position.\\n1. The game has at least one type of collectible item. Complete the `Collectible` class in `Collectible.mjs` to implement this.\\n1. At a minimum, each collectible item object created by the `Collectible` class should contain a unique `id`, a `value`, and `x` and `y` coordinates representing the item\\'s current position.\\n1. Players can use the WASD and/or arrow keys to move their avatar. Complete the `movePlayer` method in `Player.mjs` to implement this.\\n1. The `movePlayer` method should accept two arguments: a string of \"up\", \"down\", \"left\", or \"right\", and a number for the amount of pixels the player\\'s position should change. `movePlayer` should adjust the `x` and `y` coordinates of the player object it\\'s called from.\\n1. The player\\'s score should be used to calculate their rank among the other players. Complete the `calculateRank` method in the `Player` class to implement this.\\n1. The `calculateRank` method should accept an array of objects representing all connected players and return the string `Rank: currentRanking/totalPlayers`. For example, in a game with two players, if Player A has a score of 3 and Player B has a score of 5, `calculateRank` for Player A should return `Rank: 2/2`.\\n1. Players can collide with a collectible item. Complete the `collision` method in `Player.mjs` to implement this.\\n1. The `collision` method should accept a collectible item\\'s object as an argument. If the player\\'s avatar intersects with the item, the `collision` method should return `true`.\\n1. All players are kept in sync.\\n1. Players can disconnect from the game at any time.\\n1. Prevent the client from trying to guess / sniff the MIME type.\\n1. Prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\\n1. Nothing from the website is cached in the client.\\n1. The headers say that the site is powered by \"PHP 7.4.3\" even though it isn\\'t (as a security measure).\\n\\n### Testing and additional notes\\n\\n* To run the tests on Repl.it, set NODE_ENV to test without quotes in the .env file.\\n* To run the tests in the console, use the command npm run test. To open the Repl.it console, press Ctrl+Shift+P (Cmd if on a Mac) and type \"open shell\".\\n'},\n",

If this is set to true, the function shourd return a descriptive string instead of a list of ports.\\n\\nHere is the format of the string that should be returned in verbose mode (text inside `{}` indicates the information that should appear):\\n```\\nOpen ports for {URL} ({IP address})\\nPORT     SERVICE\\n{port}   {service name}\\n{port}   {service name}\\n```\\nYou can use the dictionary in `common_ports.py` to get the correct service name for each port.\\n\\nFor example, if the function is called like this:\\n```\\nport_scanner.get_open_ports(\"scanme.nmap.org\", [20, 80], True)\\n```\\nIt should return the following:\\n```\\nOpen ports for scanme.nmap.org (45.33.32.156)\\nPORT     SERVICE\\n22       ssh\\n80       http\\n```\\n\\nMake sure to include proper spacing and new line characters.\\n\\nIf the URL passed into the `get_open_ports` function is invalid, the function should return the string: \"Error: Invalid hostname\".\\n\\nIf the IP address passed into the `get_open_ports` function is invalid, the function should return the string: \"Error:  Invalid IP address\".\\n\\n### Development\\n\\nWrite your code in `port_scanner.py`.

       "  'readme_contents': '### Assignment\\n\\nFor this challenge, you will create a program to play Rock, Paper, Scissors. A program that picks at random will usually win 50% of the time. To pass this challenge your program must play matches against four different bots, winning at least 60% of the games in each match.\\n\\nIn the file `RPS.py` you are provided with a function called `player`. The function takes an argument that is a string describing the last move of the opponent (\"R\", \"P\", or \"S\"). The function should return a string representing the next move for it to play (\"R\", \"P\", or \"S\").\\n\\nA player function will receive an empty string as an argument for the first game in a match since there is no previous play.\\n\\nThe file `RPS.py` shows an example function that you will need to update. The example function is defined with two arguments (`player(prev_play, opponent_history = [])`). The function is never called with a second argument so that one is completely optional. The reason why the example function contains a second argument (`opponent_history = []`) is because that is the only way to save state between consecutive calls of the `player` function. You only need the `opponent_history` argument if you want to keep track of the opponent_history.\\n\\n*Hint: To defeat all four opponents, your program may need to have multiple strategies that change depending on the plays of the opponent.*\\n\\n### Development\\n\\nDo not modify `RPS_game.py`. Write all your code in `RPS.py`. For development, you can use `main.py` to test your code. \\n\\n`main.py` imports the game function and bots from `RPS_game.py`.\\n\\nTo test your code, play a game with the `play` function. The `play` function takes four arguments:\\n- two players to play against each other (the players are actually functions)\\n- the number of games to play in the match\\n- an optional argument to see a log of each game. Set it to `True` to see these messages.\\n\\n```py\\nplay(player1, player2, num_games[, verbose])\\n```\\nFor example, here is how you would call the function if you want `player` and `quincy` to play 1000 games against each other and you want to see the results of each game:\\n```py\\nplay(player, quincy, 1000, verbose=True)\\n```\\n\\nClick the \"run\" button and `main.py` will run.\\n\\n### Testing \\n\\nThe unit tests for this project are in `test_module.py`. We imported the tests from `test_module.py` to `main.py` for your convenience.

For example, \"235 + 52\" becomes:\\n```\\n  235\\n+  52\\n-----\\n```\\n\\nCreate a function that receives a list of strings that are arithmetic problems and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side. The function should optionally take a second argument. When the second argument is set to `True`, the answers should be displayed.\\n\\n### For example\\n\\nFunction Call:\\n```py\\narithmetic_arranger([\"32 + 698\", \"3801 - 2\", \"45 + 43\", \"123 + 49\"])\\n```\\n\\nOutput:\\n```\\n   32      3801      45      123\\n+ 698    -    2    + 43    +  49\\n-----    ------    ----    -----\\n```\\n\\nFunction Call:\\n```py\\narithmetic_arranger([\"32 + 8\", \"1 - 3801\", \"9999 + 9999\", \"523 - 49\"], True)\\n```\\n\\nOutput:\\n```\\n  32         1      9999      523\\n+  8    - 3801    + 9999    -  49\\n----    ------    ------    -----\\n  40     -3800     19998      474\\n```\\n\\n### Rules\\n\\nThe function will return the correct conversion if the supplied problems are properly formatted, otherwise, it will **return** a **string** that describes an error that is meaningful to the user.  \\n\\n\\n* Situations that will return an error:\\n  * If there are **too many problems** supplied to the function. The limit is **five**, anything more will return:\\n    `Error: Too many problems.`\\n  * The appropriate operators the function will accept are **addition** and **subtraction**. Multiplication and division will return an error. Other operators not mentioned in this bullet point will not need to be tested. The error returned will be:\\n    `Error: Operator must be \\'+\\' or \\'-\\'.`\\n  * Each number (operand) should only contain digits. Otherwise, the function will return:\\n    `Error: Numbers must only contain digits.`\\n  * Each operand (aka number on each side of the operator) has a max of four digits in width. Otherwise, the error string returned will be:\\n    `Error: Numbers cannot be more than four digits.`\\n*  If the user supplied the correct format of problems, the conversion you return will follow these rules:\\n    * There should be a single space between the operator and the longest of the two operands, the operator will be on the same line as the second operand, both operands will be in the same order as provided (the first will be the top one and the second will be the bottom.\\n    * Numbers should be right-aligned.\\n    * There should be four spaces between each problem.\\n    * There should be dashes at the bottom of each problem. The dashes should run along the entire length of each problem individually. (The example above shows what this should look like.)\\n\\n### Development\\n\\nWrite your code in `arithmetic_arranger.py`. For development, you can use `main.py` to test your `arithmetic_arranger()` function. Click the \"run\" button and `main.py` will run.\\n\\n### Testing \\n\\nThe unit tests for this project are in `test_module.py`.

Check out the [CurriculumExpansion](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/CurriculumExpansion) repository. The projects are listed as [issues](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/CurriculumExpansion/issues) where you can join in on the discussion about each one. Projects with a [help wanted](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/CurriculumExpansion/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) tag are unclaimed, so leave a comment in that issue and mention [`@scissorsneedfoodtoo`](https://github.com/scissorsneedfoodtoo) if you\\'d like to work on one. We\\'ll also need help reviewing projects that have been broken down into steps and submitted as [pull requests](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/CurriculumExpansion/pulls).\\t\\n\\n### Will the UI change?\\t\\nYes, the goal is to move to a single column layout that resembles an actual code editor. You can read more about it in [freeCodeCamp Redesign: Command Line Chic](https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/t/freecodecamp-redesign-command-line-chic/267917). Since the editor will take up the majority of the screen, things like the HTML preview, console output, and the current test you\\'re working on will appear contextually between lines of code. Here\\'s a rough example of what that might look like: ![faqs-popout-example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2051070/56576362-1c76e600-6603-11e9-9655-5870a68bbb0f.gif)\\t\\n\\n### I claimed an [open project](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/CurriculumExpansion/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22). How should I build the prototype?\\t\\nUse your favorite online code editor and post a link in your project\\'s [issue](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/CurriculumExpansion/issues) when you\\'re finished. [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [Glitch](https://glitch.com/), [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/), and [Repl.it](https://repl.it/) are a few popular platforms.\\t\\n\\n### Can I use Bootstrap/jQuery/Semantic-UI/some-other-framework-or-library to build my project?\\t\\nNo, contributors should not use any sort of framework or library while building one of the new curriculum projects. The exception is projects where it\\'s required like \"Learn React by Building Flappy Bird\". Otherwise, stick to plain ol\\' HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. (Note that this doesn\\'t apply to users, who are free to use whatever frameworks/libraries they want for the Front End Libraries Certification projects.)\\t\\n\\n### I’m building a project that teaches Express/Node/MongoDB/RESTful APIs. Can I use that?\\t\\nWe want all of this to work even when people’s browsers are offline, so we won’t have the benefit of running a server or making calls to an API. Instead, contributors should create their own return statements, error messages, and output to mock the functionality of those services. We’ll use regular expressions to test user input. That said, feel free to use these services while working on your prototype – it’ll be easier to see how your project should run.\\t\\n\\n### I finished a prototype of a project. What\\'s next?\\t\\nStart breaking it down step-by-step like [this](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/CurriculumExpansion/pull/135/files). Since the new UI will include multiple file support, break your project down into separate [HTML](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/CurriculumExpansion/blob/master/basic-javascript-role-playing-game/index.html), [CSS](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/CurriculumExpansion/blob/master/basic-javascript-role-playing-game/css/style.css), and [JS](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/CurriculumExpansion/blob/master/basic-javascript-role-playing-game/index010.js) files. Write your test descriptions in the file around the area users will be focused on during that step. For example, if the user has to add a property named `text` to an object, write your test description in the JS file [near the line](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/CurriculumExpansion/blob/794cd07d08c8926b39a0241eb075637744552433/basic-javascript-role-playing-game/index300.js#L20) the user will be focused on. Your test descriptions should be [short](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/CurriculumExpansion/blob/master/basic-javascript-role-playing-game/index050.js#L7), without a lot of explainer text. Every step will test exactly one thing, so don\\'t worry about edge cases. When you are finished, submit a pull request to the [CurriculumExpansion](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/CurriculumExpansion) repo.\\t\\n\\n### How will you handle my pull request?\\t\\nAfter you break your project down into steps and submit it as a pull request, reviewers will go through the code and test descriptions in each file. If reviewers notice something that can be changed, they\\'ll leave a comment with some suggestions. Once your project and test descriptions look good, we\\'ll merge your PR!\\t\\n\\n### My pull request was merged and my project is part of the new curriculum. Is there anything else I can do?\\t\\nAbsolutely. Please consider working on another [unclaimed project](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/CurriculumExpansion/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) or helping us review other [submitted projects](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/CurriculumExpansion/pulls). And stick around -- eventually we\\'ll start writing the actual tests that will run in the browser, so we could use your help implementing those.\\n'},\n",

The bash script in the root of this repo. We've created a script to automate this process. Make sure the script is executable by running: `chmod +x .setup-symlinks.sh`. Then run `./.setup-symlinks.sh`.\\n\\nFor Windows users wanting to use the script, you'll probably need the [Linux Subsystem](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about). We haven't tested this, so if you get this working, let us know how you did so, and we can add those steps to this guide.\\n\\nThis directory is built using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), so you can look for more info there if you run into trouble.\\n\\nTo deploy the directory, run `yarn build` or `npm run build`. Then commit the changes to Github.\\n\\n## Server\\nThe directory depends on a remote server to perform an automated webpage build for each project that requires it. The server works in the following way:\\n\\n1. A Github WebHook registers push events for all the freeCodeCamp repos. It sends a POST request (URL/event) to a server hosted in Glitch.com (Specified on the WebHook configuration)\\n1. If there is an update to the configuration file `.osfg-dir-config.js`, it downloads the file and builds an HTML file.\\n1. The file is pushed to **this repo** inside the `docs` folder.\\n1. Everything inside the `docs` folder is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages, which in turn are linked to the directory's website.\\n\\nYou can find the code for the server in [this repository](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/osfg-dir-server)\\n\\n### License\\n\\nThis computer software is licensed under the open source [BSD-3-Clause](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/open-source-for-good-directory/blob/master/LICENSE.md).\\n\\nCopyright (c) 2017, [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).\\n\"},\n",

The idea is to solve the common issues with connecting those frameworks, build a robust framework to support daily development needs, and help developers use better practices while working with popular JavaScript components.\\n\\n## Before You Begin\\nBefore you begin we recommend you read about the basic building blocks that assemble a MEAN.JS application:\\n* MongoDB - Go through [MongoDB Official Website](http://mongodb.org/) and proceed to their [Official Manual](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/), which should help you understand NoSQL and MongoDB better.\\n* Express - The best way to understand express is through its [Official Website](http://expressjs.com/), which has a [Getting Started](http://expressjs.com/starter/installing.html) guide, as well as an [ExpressJS Guide](http://expressjs.com/guide/error-handling.html) guide for general express topics. You can also go through this [StackOverflow Thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8144214/learning-express-for-node-js) for more resources.\\n* AngularJS - Angular's [Official Website](http://angularjs.org/) is a great starting point. You can also use [Thinkster Popular Guide](http://www.thinkster.io/), and the [Egghead Videos](https://egghead.io/).\\n* Node.js - Start by going through [Node.js Official Website](http://nodejs.org/) and this [StackOverflow Thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2353818/how-do-i-get-started-with-node-js), which should get you going with the Node.js platform in no time.\\n\\n\\n## Prerequisites\\nMake sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:\\n* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/download/) and the npm package manager. If you encounter any problems, you can also use this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.js.\\n* MongoDB - [Download & Install MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads), and make sure it's running on the default port (27017).\\n* Bower - You're going to use the [Bower Package Manager](http://bower.io/) to manage your front-end packages. Make sure you've installed Node.js and npm first, then install bower globally using npm:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ npm install -g bower\\n```\\n\\n* Grunt - You're going to use the [Grunt Task Runner](http://gruntjs.com/) to automate your development process. Make sure you've installed Node.js and npm first, then install grunt globally using npm:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ npm install -g grunt-cli\\n```\\n\\n## Downloading MEAN.JS\\nThere are several ways you can get the MEAN.JS boilerplate:\\n\\n### Yo Generator\\nThe recommended way would be to use the [Official Yo Generator](http://meanjs.org/generator.html), which generates the latest stable copy of the MEAN.JS boilerplate and supplies multiple sub-generators to ease your daily development cycles.\\n\\n### Cloning The GitHub Repository\\nYou can also use Git to directly clone the MEAN.JS repository:\\n```bash\\n$ git clone https://github.com/meanjs/mean.git meanjs\\n```\\nThis will clone the latest version of the MEAN.JS repository to a **meanjs** folder.\\n\\n### Downloading The Repository Zip File\\nAnother way to use the MEAN.JS boilerplate is to download a zip copy from the [master branch on GitHub](https://github.com/meanjs/mean/archive/master.zip). You can also do this using `wget` command:\\n```bash\\n$ wget https://github.com/meanjs/mean/archive/master.zip -O meanjs.zip; unzip meanjs.zip; rm meanjs.zip\\n```\\nDon't forget to rename **mean-master** after your project name.\\n\\n## Quick Install\\nOnce you've downloaded the boilerplate and installed all the prerequisites, you're just a few steps away from starting to develop your MEAN application.\\n\\nThe first thing you should do is install the Node.js dependencies. The boilerplate comes pre-bundled with a package.json file that contains the list of modules you need to start your application. To learn more about the modules installed visit the NPM & Package.json section.\\n\\nTo install Node.js dependencies you're going to use npm again. In the application folder run this in the command-line:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ npm install\\n```\\n\\nThis command does a few things:\\n* First it will install the dependencies needed for the application to run.\\n* If you're running in a development environment, it will then also install development dependencies needed for testing and running your application.\\n* Finally, when the install process is over, npm will initiate a bower install command to install all the front-end modules needed for the application.\\n\\n## Running Your Application\\nAfter the install process is over, you'll be able to run your application using Grunt. Just run grunt default task:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ grunt\\n```\\n\\nYour application should run on port 3000, so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)\\n\\nThat's it! Your application should be running. To proceed with your development, check the other sections in this documentation.\\nIf you encounter any problems, try the Troubleshooting section.\\n\\n## Testing Your Application\\nYou can run the full test suite included with MEAN.JS with the test task:\\n\\n```\\n$ grunt test\\n```\\n\\nThis will run both the server-side tests (located in the app/tests/ directory) and the client-side tests (located in the public/modules/*/tests/).\\n\\nTo execute only the server tests, run the test:server task:\\n\\n```\\n$ grunt test:server\\n```\\n\\nAnd to run only the client tests, run the test:client task:\\n\\n```\\n$ grunt test:client\\n```\\n\\n## Development and deployment With Docker\\n\\n* Install [Docker](http://www.docker.com/)\\n* Install [Fig](https://github.com/orchardup/fig)\\n\\n* Local development and testing with fig:\\n```bash\\n$ fig up\\n```\\n\\n* Local development and testing with just Docker:\\n```bash\\n$ docker build -t mean .\\n$ docker run -p 27017:27017 -d --name db mongo\\n$ docker run -p 3000:3000 --link db:db_1 mean\\n$\\n```\\n\\n* To enable live reload, forward port 35729 and mount /app and /public as volumes:\\n```bash\\n$ docker run -p 3000:3000 -p 35729:35729 -v /Users/mdl/workspace/mean-stack/mean/public:/home/mean/public -v /Users/mdl/workspace/mean-stack/mean/app:/home/mean/app --link db:db_1 mean\\n```\\n\\n## Running in a secure environment\\nTo run your application in a secure manner you'll need to use OpenSSL and generate a set of self-signed certificates. Unix-based users can use the following command:\\n```bash\\n$ sh ./scripts/generate-ssl-certs.sh\\n```\\nWindows users can follow instructions found [here](http://www.websense.com/support/article/kbarticle/How-to-use-OpenSSL-and-Microsoft-Certification-Authority).\\nAfter you've generated the key and certificate, place them in the *config/sslcerts* folder.\\n\\n## Getting Started With MEAN.JS\\nYou have your application running, but there is a lot of stuff to understand. We recommend you go over the [Official Documentation](http://meanjs.org/docs.html).\\nIn the docs we'll try to explain both general concepts of MEAN components and give you some guidelines to help you improve your development process. We tried covering as many aspects as possible, and will keep it updated by your request. You can also help us develop and improve the documentation by checking out the *gh-pages* branch of this repository.\\n\\n## Community\\n* Use the [Official Website](http://meanjs.org) to learn about changes and the roadmap.\\n* Join #meanjs on freenode.\\n* Discuss it in the new [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/meanjs)\\n* Ping us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/meanjsorg) and [Facebook](http://facebook.com/meanjs)\\n\\n## Live Example\\nBrowse the live MEAN.JS example on [http://meanjs.herokuapp.com](http://meanjs.herokuapp.com).\\n\\n## Credits\\nInspired by the great work of [Madhusudhan Srinivasa](https://github.com/madhums/)\\nThe MEAN name was coined by [Valeri Karpov](http://blog.mongodb.org/post/49262866911/the-mean-stack-mongodb-expressjs-angularjs-and)\\n\\n## License\\n(The MIT License)\\n\\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\\nthe following conditions:\\n\\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\\n\\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\\n\"},\n",

If you want to bring support for Windows, you are welcome to submit a pull request.\\n- You will have to set **SSL** for your github account.\\n- You need to have **write access** to the [**Wiki**](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/wiki) repository, otherwise you will not be able to deploy, only build.\\n\\n## Instructions\\n\\nThese are the manual instructions. If you are having errors along the way, these series of commands will make it easier to debug.\\n\\n1. Install all packages with `npm install`\\n2. Initialize and update submodules with `npm run init-pages`\\n3. Clean and create the structure for the pages with `npm run create-struc`\\n4. Build with `npm run build`\\n5. Copy the assets with `npm run copy-assets`\\n6. Copy the templates with `npm run copy-templates`\\n7. Run a local instance with `npm run start`. This will serve the wiki on `http://0.0.0.0:8000/`  **Note** that you would actually have to navigate to `http://0.0.0.0:8000/en/` or whichever language you want to actually see all the changes. Either way, make sure the url ends with `/`.\\n8. When satisfied with your changes, stop the script with `ctrl` + `c`. Use the command `npm run save-pages` to update the gatsby wiki. This will commit changes with the date as the commit message `\"Page built on date +\"%d-%m-%Y %T\"`\\n\\n## Updating the Live Wiki\\n\\nIf you just want to deploy without previewing first then run `npm run just-deploy`.\\n\\n## Directly build and preview\\n\\nIf you already made your changes and just want to quickly build and start the preview in the browser then run `npm run preview`.\\n\\n> Note: this will not deploy automatically, you will need to run `npm run save-page` to update the gatsby wiki.\\n'},\n",

For the equivalent of `IndexLink`, use `IndexLinkContainer`.\\n\\nAs with React Router's `Link`, returning `false` from an `onClick` handler on `LinkContainer` will prevent the transition. However, this behavior will not apply to any `onClick` on the child, which instead will have to call `event.preventDefault()` explicitly to prevent the transition.\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\n**Note:** Releases from v0.20.0 onward only support React Router v2.x. For React Router 1.x support, use v0.19.3 or earlier.\\n\\n```\\nnpm install react-router-bootstrap\\n```\\n\\nYou will also want to have React Router and React-Bootstrap.\\n\\n```\\nnpm install react-router react-bootstrap\\n```\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nSee [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).\\n\"},\n",

Some commands are broken\\ninto separate files such as `cmds/thanks.js` and `cmds/update.js`.\\nEach command gets a `input` which is a blob of data including what the user\\nentered, and a bot instance.\\n\\n### KBase.js\\n\\nThe Knowledge base. This is an interface to all the data in the wiki.\\n\\n### RoomMessages.js\\n\\nThis is for static messages that are fired based on regex matches.\\nIf you just want to add some basic responses, this is the place to edit.\\n\\n### How to add a new Bot Command\\n\\nLook at `BotCommands`, `echo` function. This is an example of a command being\\ncalled. Anytime a user types a line starting with `echo` that will get passed\\nto this function in input.\\n\\n```js\\necho: function(input, bot) {\\n    var username = input.message.model.fromUser.username;\\n    return \"@\" + username + \" said: \" + input.message.model.text;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe input object contains `keyword` and `params` fields.\\nIf you type `echo this` you\\'ll get\\n\\n```js\\n//input\\n{\\n    keyword: \\'echo\\',\\n    params: \\'this\\'\\n}\\n```\\n\\nFrom any command you just return the new string you want to output.\\nSo you can add new commands with this knowledge.\\n\\n### More detail on how commands are found and called\\n\\nIn `GBot.js`\\n\\n```js\\nif (input.command) {\\n    // this looks up a command and calls it\\n    output = BotCommands[input.keyword](input, this);\\n} else {\\n```\\n\\n`BotCommands` is a list of functions. E.g.\\n\\n```js\\nBotCommands.thanks = function() { ... }\\n```\\n\\nwhere `input.keyword` is `thanks` then\\n\\n`BotCommands[input.keyword]` is like saying `BotCommands.thanks()`\\n\\nso then the params get also added in `(input, this)` so its\\n\\n```js\\nBotCommands[input.keyword](input, this);\\n//becomes\\nBotCommands.thanks(input, bot);\\n```\\n\\nAll of the bot commands expect these two params. E.g. in `thanks.js`\\n\\n```js\\nvar commands = {\\n    thanks: function (input, bot) {\\n```\\n\\nIn `RoomMessages.js` we also have a table of regex and matching functions.\\n\\n```js\\n{\\n    regex: /\\\\bth?a?n?[xk]s?q?\\\\b/gim,\\n    func: BotCommands.thanks\\n}\\n```\\n\\n> We may switch all to just use this method in future. Would you like to help?\\n\\n## Environment Notes\\n\\n### wiki data\\n\\nWe use git submodules for some wiki data. to get these submodules you would do:\\n\\n```sh\\ngit submodule update --remote --checkout --init --recursive\\n```\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nHave a look at the\\n[HelpWanted](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/camperbot/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)\\nlabel issues and consider making some first steps!\\n\\nThe labels, P1 = priority one, and \\'S\\' means a small task,\\nso good places to start.\\n\\n## Chat with us!\\n\\nChat with us in the\\n[contributors chatroom](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/Contributors) if you get stuck.\\n'},\n",

Check them out, they\\'re awesome.\\n\\n*Firefox 3.0 & 2.0:* Support for FF 2 & 3 was dropped in v1.3.6. If you require support for ancient versions of FF, use v1.3.5 of store.js.\\n\\n*Important note:* In IE6 and IE7, many special characters are not allowed in the keys used to store any key/value pair. With [@mferretti](https://github.com/mferretti)\\'s help, there\\'s a suitable workaround which replaces most forbidden characters with \"___\".\\n\\n\\nStorage limits\\n--------------\\n - IE6 & IE7: 1MB total, but 128kb per \"path\" or \"document\" (see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms531424(v=vs.85).aspx)\\n - See http://dev-test.nemikor.com/web-storage/support-test/ for a list of limits per browser\\n\\nUnsupported browsers\\n-------------------\\n - Firefox 1.0: no means (beside cookies and flash)\\n - Safari 2: no means (beside cookies and flash)\\n - Safari 3: no synchronous api (has asynch sqlite api, but store.js is synch)\\n - Opera 9: don\\'t know if there is synchronous api for storing data locally\\n - Firefox 1.5: don\\'t know if there is synchronous api for storing data locally\\n - Microsoft IIS & IE7: With meta tag & \"charset=iso-8859-1\", things stop working. See issue #47.\\n\\n\\nSome notes on serialization\\n---------------------------\\nlocalStorage, when used without store.js, calls toString on all stored values. This means that you can\\'t conveniently store and retrieve numbers, objects or arrays:\\n\\n```js\\nlocalStorage.myage = 24\\nlocalStorage.myage !== 24\\nlocalStorage.myage === \\'24\\'\\n\\nlocalStorage.user = { name: \\'marcus\\', likes: \\'javascript\\' }\\nlocalStorage.user === \"[object Object]\"\\n\\nlocalStorage.tags = [\\'javascript\\', \\'localStorage\\', \\'store.js\\']\\nlocalStorage.tags.length === 32\\nlocalStorage.tags === \"javascript,localStorage,store.js\"\\n```\\n\\nWhat we want (and get with store.js) is\\n\\n```js\\nstore.set(\\'myage\\', 24)\\nstore.get(\\'myage\\') === 24\\n\\nstore.set(\\'user\\', { name: \\'marcus\\', likes: \\'javascript\\' })\\nalert(\"Hi my name is \" + store.get(\\'user\\').name + \"!\")\\n\\nstore.set(\\'tags\\', [\\'javascript\\', \\'localStorage\\', \\'store.js\\'])\\nalert(\"We\\'ve got \" + store.get(\\'tags\\').length + \" tags here\")\\n```\\n\\nThe native serialization engine of javascript is JSON. Rather than leaving it up to you to serialize and deserialize your values, store.js uses JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() on each call to store.set() and store.get(), respectively.\\n\\nSome browsers do not have native support for JSON. For those browsers you should include [JSON2.js] \\\\(non-minified copy is included in this repo).\\n\\n\\nNo sessionStorage/auto-expiration?\\n----------------------------------\\nNo. I believe there is no way to provide sessionStorage semantics cross browser. However, it is trivial to expire values on read on top of store.js:\\n\\n```js\\nvar storeWithExpiration = {\\n\\tset: function(key, val, exp) {\\n\\t\\tstore.set(key, { val:val, exp:exp, time:new Date().getTime() })\\n\\t},\\n\\tget: function(key) {\\n\\t\\tvar info = store.get(key)\\n\\t\\tif (!info) { return null }\\n\\t\\tif (new Date().getTime() - info.time > info.exp) { return null }\\n\\t\\treturn info.val\\n\\t}\\n}\\nstoreWithExpiration.set(\\'foo\\', \\'bar\\', 1000)\\nsetTimeout(function() { console.log(storeWithExpiration.get(\\'foo\\')) }, 500) // -> \"bar\"\\nsetTimeout(function() { console.log(storeWithExpiration.get(\\'foo\\')) }, 1500) // -> null\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n  [JSON2.js]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js/master/json2.js\\n  [store.min.js]: https://raw.github.com/marcuswestin/store.js/master/store.min.js\\n  [store+json2.min.js]: https://raw.github.com/marcuswestin/store.js/master/store+json2.min.js\\n '},\n",

The end goal will be its incorporation into freeCodeCamp proper as part of the coding interview preparation section.\\n\\n### Note:\\nArcade Mode has been undergoing heavy prototyping and iteration. As such, it is currently set up with development and debugging in mind.\\n\\n## Quick Start:\\n1. [Fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) using the \"Fork Button\" in the upper right hand corner of the interface.\\n2. Clone your fork using `git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/arcade-mode.git` into your projects directory (e.g., `/<YOUR_PROJECTS_DIRECTORY>/`\\n3. Go into the new arcade-mode directory.\\n4. Run `npm install` to install dependencies and start the build process. If you run into errors, please refer to the FAQ down below.\\n5. Run `npm start` and see the example app at http://localhost:8080\\n\\n## Fork Maintenance:\\n1. Set the upstream remote to the official arcade-mode repository: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/arcade-mode.git`\\n2. Update the fork locally by pulling from the upstream remote: `git pull upstream master`.\\n3. Push the updates to your fork repository with `git push origin master`.\\n\\n\\n## Contributing:\\n- After finishing Quick Start steps 1 - 4, do the following:\\n1. Find an issue that needs assistance by searching for the [Help Wanted](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/arcade-mode/labels/help%20wanted) tag.\\n2. Always make modifications on a branch. Create a branch using: `git checkout -b <BRANCH_NAME>`.\\n3. Test modifications with unit tests `npm run test:client` and in-app validation on the browser.\\n3. Once it all checks out, submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).\\n\\nFor a more complete guide, see CONTRIBUTING.md.\\n\\n## FAQ:\\n\\n> I\\'m receiving errors about the npm package, canvas. How can I fix this?\\n\\nThe canvas package has prerequisites that need to be installed before canvas can be installed correctly. Please refer to [its npm page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas) for installation instructions that depend on the operating system.\\n\\n> I\\'m receiving `package not found` errors on `npm install`. How can I fix this?\\n\\nTry removing the `node_modules` directory, then `npm install` again. If this does not work, remove both `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` and try `npm install` again.\\n\\n> I\\'m receiving the error \"Received a non-Vinyl object in `dest()`\". How can I fix this?\\n\\nRemove the node_modules folder and `npm install` again.\\n\\n> Is there a way I can automate `npm run test:client` to run when I try to push?\\n\\nYou can use git hooks. We are currently using this `pre-push` script [here](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/arcade-mode/blob/master/bin/pre-push), but you may want to tailor it to a different branch or all branches. The project\\'s git hooks can be found in the `/bin` directory (i.e., `pre-push` and `post-merge`).\\n'},\n",

The various \"transformer\"\\nplugins transform `File` nodes into various other types of data e.g.\\n`gatsby-transformer-json` transforms JSON files into JSON data nodes and\\n`gatsby-transformer-remark` transforms markdown files into `MarkdownRemark`\\nnodes from which you can query an HTML representation of the markdown.\\n\\n## Install\\n\\n`npm install --save gatsby-source-filesystem`\\n\\n## How to use\\n\\n```javascript\\n// In your gatsby-config.js\\nmodule.exports = {\\n  plugins: [\\n    // You can have multiple instances of this plugin\\n    // to read source nodes from different locations on your\\n    // filesystem.\\n    //\\n    // The following sets up the Jekyll pattern of having a\\n    // \"pages\" directory for Markdown files and a \"data\" directory\\n    // for `.json`, `.yaml`, `.csv`.\\n    {\\n      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,\\n      options: {\\n        name: `pages`,\\n        path: `${__dirname}/src/pages/`,\\n      },\\n    },\\n    {\\n      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,\\n      options: {\\n        name: `data`,\\n        path: `${__dirname}/src/data/`,\\n      },\\n    },\\n  ],\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## How to query\\n\\nYou can query file nodes like the following:\\n\\n```graphql\\n{\\n  allFile {\\n    edges {\\n      node {\\n        extension\\n        dir\\n        modifiedTime\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Helper functions\\n\\n`gatsby-source-filesystem` exports two helper functions:\\n\\n- `createFilePath`\\n- `createRemoteFileNode`\\n\\n### createFilePath\\n\\nWhen building pages from files, you often want to create a URL from a file\\'s path on the file system. E.g. if you have a markdown file at `src/content/2018-01-23-an-exploration-of-the-nature-of-reality/index.md`, you might want to turn that into a page on your site at `example.com/2018-01-23-an-exploration-of-the-nature-of-reality/`. `createFilePath` is a helper function to make this task easier.\\n\\n```javascript\\ncreateFilePath({\\n  // The node you\\'d like to convert to a path\\n  // e.g. from a markdown, JSON, YAML file, etc\\n  node:\\n  // Method used to get a node\\n  // The parameter from `onCreateNode` should be passed in here\\n  getNode:\\n  // The base path for your files.\\n  // Defaults to `src/pages`. For the example above, you\\'d use `src/contents`.\\n  basePath:\\n  // Whether you want your file paths to contain a trailing `/` slash\\n  // Defaults to true\\n  trailingSlash:\\n})\\n```\\n\\n#### Example usage\\n\\nThe following is taken from [Gatsby Tutorial, Part Seven](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-seven/) and is used to create URL slugs for markdown pages.\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst { createFilePath } = require(`gatsby-source-filesystem`)\\n\\nexports.onCreateNode = ({ node, getNode, boundActionCreators }) => {\\n  const { createNodeField } = boundActionCreators\\n  // Ensures we are processing only markdown files\\n  if (node.internal.type === \"MarkdownRemark\") {\\n    // Use `createFilePath` to turn markdown files in our `data/faqs` directory into `/faqs/slug`\\n    const relativeFilePath = createFilePath({\\n      node,\\n      getNode,\\n      basePath: \"data/faqs/\",\\n    })\\n\\n    // Creates new query\\'able field with name of \\'slug\\'\\n    createNodeField({\\n      node,\\n      name: \"slug\",\\n      value: `/faqs${relativeFilePath}`,\\n    })\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### createRemoteFileNode\\n\\nWhen building source plugins for remote data sources such as headless CMSs, their data will often link to files stored remotely that are often convenient to download so you can work with them locally.\\n\\nThe `createRemoteFileNode` helper makes it easy to download remote files and add them to your site\\'s GraphQL schema.\\n\\n```javascript\\ncreateRemoteFileNode({\\n  // The source url of the remote file\\n  url: `https://example.com/a-file.jpg`,\\n\\n  // The redux store which is passed to all Node APIs.\\n  store,\\n\\n  // Gatsby\\'s cache which the helper uses to check if the file has been downloaded already. It\\'s passed to all Node APIs.\\n  cache,\\n\\n  // The boundActionCreator used to create nodes\\n  createNode,\\n\\n  // OPTIONAL\\n  // Adds htaccess authentication to the download request if passed in.\\n  auth: { htaccess_user: `USER`, htaccess_pass: `PASSWORD` },\\n})\\n```\\n\\n#### Example usage\\n\\nThe following example is pulled from [gatsby-source-wordpress](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-source-wordpress). Downloaded files are created as `File` nodes and then linked to the WordPress Media node, so it can be queried both as a regular `File` node and from the `localFile` field in the Media node.\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst { createRemoteFileNode } = require(`gatsby-source-filesystem`)\\n\\nexports.downloadMediaFiles = ({ nodes, store, cache, createNode, _auth }) => {\\n  nodes.map(async node => {\\n    let fileNode\\n    // Ensures we are only processing Media Files\\n    // `wordpress__wp_media` is the media file type name for Wordpress\\n    if (node.__type === `wordpress__wp_media`) {\\n      try {\\n        fileNode = await createRemoteFileNode({\\n          url: node.source_url,\\n          store,\\n          cache,\\n          createNode,\\n          auth: _auth,\\n        })\\n      } catch (e) {\\n        // Ignore\\n      }\\n    }\\n\\n    // Adds a field `localFile` to the node\\n    // ___NODE appendix tells Gatsby that this field will link to another node\\n    if (fileNode) {\\n      node.localFile___NODE = fileNode.id\\n    }\\n  })\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe file node can then be queried using GraphQL. See an example of this in the [gatsby-source-wordpress README](/packages/gatsby-source-wordpress/#image-processing) where downloaded images are queried using [gatsby-transformer-sharp](/packages/gatsby-transformer-sharp/) to use in the component [gatsby-image](/packages/gatsby-image/).\\n'},\n",
