In addition, these topics commonly appear in interview questions. Primary categories include:\\n\\n- **Common JavaScript Interview Questions**\\n- **Web Technologies & Web Standards**\\n- **Algorithm design/efficiency, time complexity, dynamic programming, etc.**\\n- **Data Structures and Database Technologies**\\n- **System Design**\\n- **Design Principles (OOP, FP, etc)**\\n- **Application & Web Security Questions**\\n- **DevOps, knowledge of cloud & server technologies (e.g. Heroku, AWS, Elasticsearch, memcached, etc.)**\\n- **... and more**\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe challenges all live in the `src/challenges` directory. Each category has a separate `JSON` file which is structured similar to the other challenge seed files in the core freeCodeCamp repository. To contribute a challenge, simply make a pull request with your challenge question(s) in the appropriate seed file. To run this project locally, fork it to your machine and run `npm install` followed by `npm start` at the root level. Now you can add new questions and see them locally.

Add the file `.osfg-dir-config.js` to the **root of the Project**. \\n    * This will trigger an automatic build of the Project's page inside the directory.\\n    * Please **verify** that an **update** by CamperBot to `docs/[project-name]` has occurred in the master branch of the directory.\\n    * Fields:\\n      * **title:** Displayed at the top and as the webpage title\\n      * **demoVideo:** the YouTube video address\\n      * **liveDemo:** the address of the project's homepage\\n      * **description:** an ES6 template string that contains GitHub-flavored Markdown. Keep this relatively short - a paragraph tops.\\n      * **body:** an ES6 template string with GitHub-flavored Markdown. Please include the open source license, with the  freeCodeCamp copyright at the end.\\n      * If the `liveDemo` or the `demoVideo` aren't yet available, you can exclued them. They just won't be added to the project's page.\\n\\n    * You can see a [**sample config file**](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/open-source-for-good-directory/blob/master/.osfg-dir-config.js) at the root of this repository.\\n\\n2. Edit the file `repo-list.json` at the root of the directory to include the project.\\n    * This file will tell the directory app to fetch the corresponding GitHub data and include a card for the project.\\n    * If you don't yet have permissions to update this repo, please **request the edit** from one of the project's  maintainers.\\n    * Instructions for the file: \\n      * Please keep this file **alphabetically sorted** by repo name\\n      * **Everything** should be in **lower case**. This is critical to our search functionality\\n      * **name:** the GitHub repo's name in lower case (without the preceeding freecodecamp/)\\n      * **icon:** the Image to be displayed in the project's card. This string contains a\\n        [Font Awesome icon HTML class](http://fontawesome.io/icons/).\\n      * **tags:** tags will be visible to users who aren't authenticated (we assume these users are people at nonprofits)\\n      * **status:** choose between `'dev'` and `'prod'`. Projects in `'dev'` won't be displayed to nonprofits (unauthenticated users).\\n\\nPlease be paitient and while GitHub updates the directory - it will take a few minutes before the changes are reflected.\\n\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nMake sure you have installed a recent version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and **npm**.\\n\\nOpen the folder you wish to install the project in using your terminal, and run:\\n\\n`git clone https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/open-source-for-good-directory`\\n\\n`cd` into the `open-source-for-good-directory` project that command created, then run `npm i` to install all the project dependencies. \\n\\nYou'll need symbolic links inside the `public` folder that point to the corresponding `docs/[project-name]` directory. The bash script in the root of this repo. We've created a script to automate this process. Make sure the script is executable by running: `chmod +x .setup-symlinks.sh`. Then run `./.setup-symlinks.sh`.\\n\\nFor Windows users wanting to use the script, you'll probably need the [Linux Subsystem](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about).

Then commit the changes to Github.\\n\\n## Server\\nThe directory depends on a remote server to perform an automated webpage build for each project that requires it. The server works in the following way:\\n\\n1. A Github WebHook registers push events for all the freeCodeCamp repos.

The idea is to solve the common issues with connecting those frameworks, build a robust framework to support daily development needs, and help developers use better practices while working with popular JavaScript components.\\n\\n## Before You Begin\\nBefore you begin we recommend you read about the basic building blocks that assemble a MEAN.JS application:\\n* MongoDB - Go through [MongoDB Official Website](http://mongodb.org/) and proceed to their [Official Manual](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/), which should help you understand NoSQL and MongoDB better.\\n* Express - The best way to understand express is through its [Official Website](http://expressjs.com/), which has a [Getting Started](http://expressjs.com/starter/installing.html) guide, as well as an [ExpressJS Guide](http://expressjs.com/guide/error-handling.html) guide for general express topics. You can also go through this [StackOverflow Thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8144214/learning-express-for-node-js) for more resources.\\n* AngularJS - Angular's [Official Website](http://angularjs.org/) is a great starting point. You can also use [Thinkster Popular Guide](http://www.thinkster.io/), and the [Egghead Videos](https://egghead.io/).\\n* Node.js - Start by going through [Node.js Official Website](http://nodejs.org/) and this [StackOverflow Thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2353818/how-do-i-get-started-with-node-js), which should get you going with the Node.js platform in no time.\\n\\n\\n## Prerequisites\\nMake sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:\\n* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/download/) and the npm package manager. If you encounter any problems, you can also use this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.js.\\n* MongoDB - [Download & Install MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads), and make sure it's running on the default port (27017).\\n* Bower - You're going to use the [Bower Package Manager](http://bower.io/) to manage your front-end packages. Make sure you've installed Node.js and npm first, then install bower globally using npm:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ npm install -g bower\\n```\\n\\n* Grunt - You're going to use the [Grunt Task Runner](http://gruntjs.com/) to automate your development process. Make sure you've installed Node.js and npm first, then install grunt globally using npm:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ npm install -g grunt-cli\\n```\\n\\n## Downloading MEAN.JS\\nThere are several ways you can get the MEAN.JS boilerplate:\\n\\n### Yo Generator\\nThe recommended way would be to use the [Official Yo Generator](http://meanjs.org/generator.html), which generates the latest stable copy of the MEAN.JS boilerplate and supplies multiple sub-generators to ease your daily development cycles.\\n\\n### Cloning The GitHub Repository\\nYou can also use Git to directly clone the MEAN.JS repository:\\n```bash\\n$ git clone https://github.com/meanjs/mean.git meanjs\\n```\\nThis will clone the latest version of the MEAN.JS repository to a **meanjs** folder.\\n\\n### Downloading The Repository Zip File\\nAnother way to use the MEAN.JS boilerplate is to download a zip copy from the [master branch on GitHub](https://github.com/meanjs/mean/archive/master.zip). You can also do this using `wget` command:\\n```bash\\n$ wget https://github.com/meanjs/mean/archive/master.zip -O meanjs.zip; unzip meanjs.zip; rm meanjs.zip\\n```\\nDon't forget to rename **mean-master** after your project name.\\n\\n## Quick Install\\nOnce you've downloaded the boilerplate and installed all the prerequisites, you're just a few steps away from starting to develop your MEAN application.\\n\\nThe first thing you should do is install the Node.js dependencies. The boilerplate comes pre-bundled with a package.json file that contains the list of modules you need to start your application. To learn more about the modules installed visit the NPM & Package.json section.\\n\\nTo install Node.js dependencies you're going to use npm again. In the application folder run this in the command-line:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ npm install\\n```\\n\\nThis command does a few things:\\n* First it will install the dependencies needed for the application to run.\\n* If you're running in a development environment, it will then also install development dependencies needed for testing and running your application.\\n* Finally, when the install process is over, npm will initiate a bower install command to install all the front-end modules needed for the application.\\n\\n## Running Your Application\\nAfter the install process is over, you'll be able to run your application using Grunt. Just run grunt default task:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ grunt\\n```\\n\\nYour application should run on port 3000, so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)\\n\\nThat's it! Your application should be running. To proceed with your development, check the other sections in this documentation.\\nIf you encounter any problems, try the Troubleshooting section.\\n\\n## Testing Your Application\\nYou can run the full test suite included with MEAN.JS with the test task:\\n\\n```\\n$ grunt test\\n```\\n\\nThis will run both the server-side tests (located in the app/tests/ directory) and the client-side tests (located in the public/modules/*/tests/).\\n\\nTo execute only the server tests, run the test:server task:\\n\\n```\\n$ grunt test:server\\n```\\n\\nAnd to run only the client tests, run the test:client task:\\n\\n```\\n$ grunt test:client\\n```\\n\\n## Development and deployment With Docker\\n\\n* Install [Docker](http://www.docker.com/)\\n* Install [Fig](https://github.com/orchardup/fig)\\n\\n* Local development and testing with fig:\\n```bash\\n$ fig up\\n```\\n\\n* Local development and testing with just Docker:\\n```bash\\n$ docker build -t mean .\\n$ docker run -p 27017:27017 -d --name db mongo\\n$ docker run -p 3000:3000 --link db:db_1 mean\\n$\\n```\\n\\n* To enable live reload, forward port 35729 and mount /app and /public as volumes:\\n```bash\\n$ docker run -p 3000:3000 -p 35729:35729 -v /Users/mdl/workspace/mean-stack/mean/public:/home/mean/public -v /Users/mdl/workspace/mean-stack/mean/app:/home/mean/app --link db:db_1 mean\\n```\\n\\n## Running in a secure environment\\nTo run your application in a secure manner you'll need to use OpenSSL and generate a set of self-signed certificates. Unix-based users can use the following command:\\n```bash\\n$ sh ./scripts/generate-ssl-certs.sh\\n```\\nWindows users can follow instructions found [here](http://www.websense.com/support/article/kbarticle/How-to-use-OpenSSL-and-Microsoft-Certification-Authority).\\nAfter you've generated the key and certificate, place them in the *config/sslcerts* folder.\\n\\n## Getting Started With MEAN.JS\\nYou have your application running, but there is a lot of stuff to understand. We recommend you go over the [Official Documentation](http://meanjs.org/docs.html).\\nIn the docs we'll try to explain both general concepts of MEAN components and give you some guidelines to help you improve your development process. We tried covering as many aspects as possible, and will keep it updated by your request. You can also help us develop and improve the documentation by checking out the *gh-pages* branch of this repository.\\n\\n## Community\\n* Use the [Official Website](http://meanjs.org) to learn about changes and the roadmap.\\n* Join #meanjs on freenode.\\n* Discuss it in the new [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/meanjs)\\n* Ping us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/meanjsorg) and [Facebook](http://facebook.com/meanjs)\\n\\n## Live Example\\nBrowse the live MEAN.JS example on [http://meanjs.herokuapp.com](http://meanjs.herokuapp.com).\\n\\n## Credits\\nInspired by the great work of [Madhusudhan Srinivasa](https://github.com/madhums/)\\nThe MEAN name was coined by [Valeri Karpov](http://blog.mongodb.org/post/49262866911/the-mean-stack-mongodb-expressjs-angularjs-and)\\n\\n## License\\n(The MIT License)\\n\\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\\nthe following conditions:\\n\\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\\n\\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\\n\"},\n",

If you want to bring support for Windows, you are welcome to submit a pull request.\\n- You will have to set **SSL** for your github account.\\n- You need to have **write access** to the [**Wiki**](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/wiki) repository, otherwise you will not be able to deploy, only build.\\n\\n## Instructions\\n\\nThese are the manual instructions. If you are having errors along the way, these series of commands will make it easier to debug.\\n\\n1. Install all packages with `npm install`\\n2. Initialize and update submodules with `npm run init-pages`\\n3. Clean and create the structure for the pages with `npm run create-struc`\\n4. Build with `npm run build`\\n5. Copy the assets with `npm run copy-assets`\\n6. Copy the templates with `npm run copy-templates`\\n7. Run a local instance with `npm run start`. This will serve the wiki on `http://0.0.0.0:8000/`  **Note** that you would actually have to navigate to `http://0.0.0.0:8000/en/` or whichever language you want to actually see all the changes. Either way, make sure the url ends with `/`.\\n8. When satisfied with your changes, stop the script with `ctrl` + `c`. Use the command `npm run save-pages` to update the gatsby wiki. This will commit changes with the date as the commit message `\"Page built on date +\"%d-%m-%Y %T\"`\\n\\n## Updating the Live Wiki\\n\\nIf you just want to deploy without previewing first then run `npm run just-deploy`.\\n\\n## Directly build and preview\\n\\nIf you already made your changes and just want to quickly build and start the preview in the browser then run `npm run preview`.\\n\\n> Note: this will not deploy automatically, you will need to run `npm run save-page` to update the gatsby wiki.\\n'},\n",

Some commands are broken\\ninto separate files such as `cmds/thanks.js` and `cmds/update.js`.\\nEach command gets a `input` which is a blob of data including what the user\\nentered, and a bot instance.\\n\\n### KBase.js\\n\\nThe Knowledge base. This is an interface to all the data in the wiki.\\n\\n### RoomMessages.js\\n\\nThis is for static messages that are fired based on regex matches.\\nIf you just want to add some basic responses, this is the place to edit.\\n\\n### How to add a new Bot Command\\n\\nLook at `BotCommands`, `echo` function. This is an example of a command being\\ncalled. Anytime a user types a line starting with `echo` that will get passed\\nto this function in input.\\n\\n```js\\necho: function(input, bot) {\\n    var username = input.message.model.fromUser.username;\\n    return \"@\" + username + \" said: \" + input.message.model.text;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe input object contains `keyword` and `params` fields.\\nIf you type `echo this` you\\'ll get\\n\\n```js\\n//input\\n{\\n    keyword: \\'echo\\',\\n    params: \\'this\\'\\n}\\n```\\n\\nFrom any command you just return the new string you want to output.\\nSo you can add new commands with this knowledge.\\n\\n### More detail on how commands are found and called\\n\\nIn `GBot.js`\\n\\n```js\\nif (input.command) {\\n    // this looks up a command and calls it\\n    output = BotCommands[input.keyword](input, this);\\n} else {\\n```\\n\\n`BotCommands` is a list of functions. E.g.\\n\\n```js\\nBotCommands.thanks = function() { ... }\\n```\\n\\nwhere `input.keyword` is `thanks` then\\n\\n`BotCommands[input.keyword]` is like saying `BotCommands.thanks()`\\n\\nso then the params get also added in `(input, this)` so its\\n\\n```js\\nBotCommands[input.keyword](input, this);\\n//becomes\\nBotCommands.thanks(input, bot);\\n```\\n\\nAll of the bot commands expect these two params. E.g. in `thanks.js`\\n\\n```js\\nvar commands = {\\n    thanks: function (input, bot) {\\n```\\n\\nIn `RoomMessages.js` we also have a table of regex and matching functions.\\n\\n```js\\n{\\n    regex: /\\\\bth?a?n?[xk]s?q?\\\\b/gim,\\n    func: BotCommands.thanks\\n}\\n```\\n\\n> We may switch all to just use this method in future. Would you like to help?\\n\\n## Environment Notes\\n\\n### wiki data\\n\\nWe use git submodules for some wiki data. to get these submodules you would do:\\n\\n```sh\\ngit submodule update --remote --checkout --init --recursive\\n```\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nHave a look at the\\n[HelpWanted](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/camperbot/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)\\nlabel issues and consider making some first steps!\\n\\nThe labels, P1 = priority one, and \\'S\\' means a small task,\\nso good places to start.\\n\\n## Chat with us!\\n\\nChat with us in the\\n[contributors chatroom](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/Contributors) if you get stuck.\\n'},\n",

       "  'readme_contents': 'How does it work?\\n------------------\\nstore.js uses localStorage when available, and falls back on the userData behavior in IE6 and IE7. No flash to slow down your page load. No cookies to fatten your network requests.\\n\\nstore.js depends on JSON for serialization to disk.\\n\\n\\nInstallation\\n------------\\nJust grab [store.min.js] or [store+json2.min.js] and include them with a script tag.\\n\\n\\n`store.enabled` flag\\n--------------------\\nIf your product depends on store.js, you must check the `store.enabled` flag first:\\n\\n```html\\n<script src=\"store.min.js\"></script>\\n<script>\\n\\tinit()\\n\\tfunction init() {\\n\\t\\tif (!store.enabled) {\\n\\t\\t\\talert(\\'Local storage is not supported by your browser. Please disable \"Private Mode\", or upgrade to a modern browser.\\')\\n\\t\\t\\treturn\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\tvar user = store.get(\\'user\\')\\n\\t\\t// ... and so on ...\\n\\t}\\n</script>\\n```\\n\\nLocalStorage may sometimes appear to be available but throw an error when used. An example is Safari\\'s private browsing mode. Other browsers allow the user to temporarily disable localStorage. Store.js detects these conditions and sets the `store.enabled` flag appropriately.\\n\\n\\nScreencast\\n-----------\\n[Introductory Screencast to Store.js](http://javascriptplayground.com/blog/2012/06/javascript-local-storage-store-js-tutorial) by Jack Franklin.\\n\\n\\nContributors & Forks\\n--------------------\\nContributors: https://github.com/marcuswestin/store.js/graphs/contributors\\n\\nForks: https://github.com/marcuswestin/store.js/network/members\\n\\n\\nIn node.js\\n----------\\nstore.js works as expected in node.js, assuming that global.localStorage has been set:\\n\\n```\\nglobal.localStorage = require(\\'localStorage\\')\\nvar store = require(\\'./store\\')\\nstore.set(\\'foo\\', 1)\\nconsole.log(store.get(\\'foo\\'))\\n```\\n\\n\\nSupported browsers\\n------------------\\n - Tested in iOS 4+\\n - Tested in Firefox 3.5\\n - Tested in Firefox 3.6\\n - Tested in Firefox 4.0+\\n - Support dropped for Firefox < 3.5 (see notes below)\\n - Tested in Chrome 5\\n - Tested in Chrome 6\\n - Tested in Chrome 7\\n - Tested in Chrome 8\\n - Tested in Chrome 10\\n - Tested in Chrome 11+\\n - Tested in Safari 4\\n - Tested in Safari 5\\n - Tested in IE6\\n - Tested in IE7\\n - Tested in IE8\\n - Tested in IE9\\n - Tested in IE10\\n - Tested in Opera 10\\n - Tested in Opera 11\\n - Tested in Opera 12\\n - Tested in Node.js v0.10.4 (with https://github.com/coolaj86/node-localStorage 1.0.2)\\n\\n*Private mode* Store.js may not work while browsing in private mode. This is as it should be. Check the `store.enabled` flag before relying on store.js.\\n\\n*Saucelabs.com rocks* Extensive browser testing of store.js is possible thanks to Saucelabs.com. Check them out, they\\'re awesome.\\n\\n*Firefox 3.0 & 2.0:* Support for FF 2 & 3 was dropped in v1.3.6. If you require support for ancient versions of FF, use v1.3.5 of store.js.\\n\\n*Important note:* In IE6 and IE7, many special characters are not allowed in the keys used to store any key/value pair. With [@mferretti](https://github.com/mferretti)\\'s help, there\\'s a suitable workaround which replaces most forbidden characters with \"___\".\\n\\n\\nStorage limits\\n--------------\\n - IE6 & IE7: 1MB total, but 128kb per \"path\" or \"document\" (see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms531424(v=vs.85).aspx)\\n - See http://dev-test.nemikor.com/web-storage/support-test/ for a list of limits per browser\\n\\nUnsupported browsers\\n-------------------\\n - Firefox 1.0: no means (beside cookies and flash)\\n - Safari 2: no means (beside cookies and flash)\\n - Safari 3: no synchronous api (has asynch sqlite api, but store.js is synch)\\n - Opera 9: don\\'t know if there is synchronous api for storing data locally\\n - Firefox 1.5: don\\'t know if there is synchronous api for storing data locally\\n - Microsoft IIS & IE7: With meta tag & \"charset=iso-8859-1\", things stop working. See issue #47.\\n\\n\\nSome notes on serialization\\n---------------------------\\nlocalStorage, when used without store.js, calls toString on all stored values. This means that you can\\'t conveniently store and retrieve numbers, objects or arrays:\\n\\n```js\\nlocalStorage.myage = 24\\nlocalStorage.myage !== 24\\nlocalStorage.myage === \\'24\\'\\n\\nlocalStorage.user = { name: \\'marcus\\', likes: \\'javascript\\' }\\nlocalStorage.user === \"[object Object]\"\\n\\nlocalStorage.tags = [\\'javascript\\', \\'localStorage\\', \\'store.js\\']\\nlocalStorage.tags.length === 32\\nlocalStorage.tags === \"javascript,localStorage,store.js\"\\n```\\n\\nWhat we want (and get with store.js) is\\n\\n```js\\nstore.set(\\'myage\\', 24)\\nstore.get(\\'myage\\') === 24\\n\\nstore.set(\\'user\\', { name: \\'marcus\\', likes: \\'javascript\\' })\\nalert(\"Hi my name is \" + store.get(\\'user\\').name + \"!\")\\n\\nstore.set(\\'tags\\', [\\'javascript\\', \\'localStorage\\', \\'store.js\\'])\\nalert(\"We\\'ve got \" + store.get(\\'tags\\').length + \" tags here\")\\n```\\n\\nThe native serialization engine of javascript is JSON. Rather than leaving it up to you to serialize and deserialize your values, store.js uses JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() on each call to store.set() and store.get(), respectively.\\n\\nSome browsers do not have native support for JSON. For those browsers you should include [JSON2.js] \\\\(non-minified copy is included in this repo).\\n\\n\\nNo sessionStorage/auto-expiration?\\n----------------------------------\\nNo. I believe there is no way to provide sessionStorage semantics cross browser. However, it is trivial to expire values on read on top of store.js:\\n\\n```js\\nvar storeWithExpiration = {\\n\\tset: function(key, val, exp) {\\n\\t\\tstore.set(key, { val:val, exp:exp, time:new Date().getTime() })\\n\\t},\\n\\tget: function(key) {\\n\\t\\tvar info = store.get(key)\\n\\t\\tif (!info) { return null }\\n\\t\\tif (new Date().getTime() - info.time > info.exp) { return null }\\n\\t\\treturn info.val\\n\\t}\\n}\\nstoreWithExpiration.set(\\'foo\\', \\'bar\\', 1000)\\nsetTimeout(function() { console.log(storeWithExpiration.get(\\'foo\\')) }, 500) // -> \"bar\"\\nsetTimeout(function() { console.log(storeWithExpiration.get(\\'foo\\')) }, 1500) // -> null\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n  [JSON2.js]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js/master/json2.js\\n  [store.min.js]: https://raw.github.com/marcuswestin/store.js/master/store.min.js\\n  [store+json2.min.js]: https://raw.github.com/marcuswestin/store.js/master/store+json2.min.js\\n '},\n",

The end goal will be its incorporation into freeCodeCamp proper as part of the coding interview preparation section.\\n\\n### Note:\\nArcade Mode has been undergoing heavy prototyping and iteration. As such, it is currently set up with development and debugging in mind.\\n\\n## Quick Start:\\n1. [Fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) using the \"Fork Button\" in the upper right hand corner of the interface.\\n2. Clone your fork using `git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/arcade-mode.git` into your projects directory (e.g., `/<YOUR_PROJECTS_DIRECTORY>/`\\n3. Go into the new arcade-mode directory.\\n4. Run `npm install` to install dependencies and start the build process. If you run into errors, please refer to the FAQ down below.\\n5. Run `npm start` and see the example app at http://localhost:8080\\n\\n## Fork Maintenance:\\n1. Set the upstream remote to the official arcade-mode repository: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/arcade-mode.git`\\n2. Update the fork locally by pulling from the upstream remote: `git pull upstream master`.\\n3. Push the updates to your fork repository with `git push origin master`.\\n\\n\\n## Contributing:\\n- After finishing Quick Start steps 1 - 4, do the following:\\n1. Find an issue that needs assistance by searching for the [Help Wanted](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/arcade-mode/labels/help%20wanted) tag.\\n2. Always make modifications on a branch. Create a branch using: `git checkout -b <BRANCH_NAME>`.\\n3. Test modifications with unit tests `npm run test:client` and in-app validation on the browser.\\n3. Once it all checks out, submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).\\n\\nFor a more complete guide, see CONTRIBUTING.md.\\n\\n## FAQ:\\n\\n> I\\'m receiving errors about the npm package, canvas. How can I fix this?\\n\\nThe canvas package has prerequisites that need to be installed before canvas can be installed correctly. Please refer to [its npm page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas) for installation instructions that depend on the operating system.\\n\\n> I\\'m receiving `package not found` errors on `npm install`. How can I fix this?\\n\\nTry removing the `node_modules` directory, then `npm install` again. If this does not work, remove both `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` and try `npm install` again.\\n\\n> I\\'m receiving the error \"Received a non-Vinyl object in `dest()`\". How can I fix this?\\n\\nRemove the node_modules folder and `npm install` again.\\n\\n> Is there a way I can automate `npm run test:client` to run when I try to push?\\n\\nYou can use git hooks. We are currently using this `pre-push` script [here](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/arcade-mode/blob/master/bin/pre-push), but you may want to tailor it to a different branch or all branches. The project\\'s git hooks can be found in the `/bin` directory (i.e., `pre-push` and `post-merge`).\\n'},\n",

But more and more teachers are using it to teach groups of students at a time. There is also an increasing number of study groups forming around freecodecamp. However, freecodecamp was not built with the group experience in mind. The goal of this project is to serve teachers and study groups.\\n\\nYou can view the interactive prototype for our MVP [here](https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/J3C03W2SX#/screens)\\n\\n## Vision\\n\\n> It’s 10pm at night, you’re in a remote town, you should be able to log on virtually and code with a community.\\n\\nWe envision a multitude of communities around the world empowering themselves to learn coding. Our goal is to foster community learning.\\n\\n## Values\\n\\nWe strive to create a supportive learning environment for our contributors where they can find mentors as well as mentor others. We do this by encouraging pair programming as well as group coding sessions over zoom.\\n\\nWe take a data driven approach towards designing this product based on user feedback. We practice the principles of Lean Startup.\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nWe welcome pull-requests from freecodecamp campers.

       "  'readme_contents': '# gatsby-source-filesystem\\n\\nPlugin for creating `File` nodes from the file system. The various \"transformer\"\\nplugins transform `File` nodes into various other types of data e.g.\\n`gatsby-transformer-json` transforms JSON files into JSON data nodes and\\n`gatsby-transformer-remark` transforms markdown files into `MarkdownRemark`\\nnodes from which you can query an HTML representation of the markdown.\\n\\n## Install\\n\\n`npm install --save gatsby-source-filesystem`\\n\\n## How to use\\n\\n```javascript\\n// In your gatsby-config.js\\nmodule.exports = {\\n  plugins: [\\n    // You can have multiple instances of this plugin\\n    // to read source nodes from different locations on your\\n    // filesystem.\\n    //\\n    // The following sets up the Jekyll pattern of having a\\n    // \"pages\" directory for Markdown files and a \"data\" directory\\n    // for `.json`, `.yaml`, `.csv`.\\n    {\\n      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,\\n      options: {\\n        name: `pages`,\\n        path: `${__dirname}/src/pages/`,\\n      },\\n    },\\n    {\\n      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,\\n      options: {\\n        name: `data`,\\n        path: `${__dirname}/src/data/`,\\n      },\\n    },\\n  ],\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## How to query\\n\\nYou can query file nodes like the following:\\n\\n```graphql\\n{\\n  allFile {\\n    edges {\\n      node {\\n        extension\\n        dir\\n        modifiedTime\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Helper functions\\n\\n`gatsby-source-filesystem` exports two helper functions:\\n\\n- `createFilePath`\\n- `createRemoteFileNode`\\n\\n### createFilePath\\n\\nWhen building pages from files, you often want to create a URL from a file\\'s path on the file system. E.g. if you have a markdown file at `src/content/2018-01-23-an-exploration-of-the-nature-of-reality/index.md`, you might want to turn that into a page on your site at `example.com/2018-01-23-an-exploration-of-the-nature-of-reality/`. `createFilePath` is a helper function to make this task easier.\\n\\n```javascript\\ncreateFilePath({\\n  // The node you\\'d like to convert to a path\\n  // e.g. from a markdown, JSON, YAML file, etc\\n  node:\\n  // Method used to get a node\\n  // The parameter from `onCreateNode` should be passed in here\\n  getNode:\\n  // The base path for your files.\\n  // Defaults to `src/pages`. For the example above, you\\'d use `src/contents`.\\n  basePath:\\n  // Whether you want your file paths to contain a trailing `/` slash\\n  // Defaults to true\\n  trailingSlash:\\n})\\n```\\n\\n#### Example usage\\n\\nThe following is taken from [Gatsby Tutorial, Part Seven](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-seven/) and is used to create URL slugs for markdown pages.\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst { createFilePath } = require(`gatsby-source-filesystem`)\\n\\nexports.onCreateNode = ({ node, getNode, boundActionCreators }) => {\\n  const { createNodeField } = boundActionCreators\\n  // Ensures we are processing only markdown files\\n  if (node.internal.type === \"MarkdownRemark\") {\\n    // Use `createFilePath` to turn markdown files in our `data/faqs` directory into `/faqs/slug`\\n    const relativeFilePath = createFilePath({\\n      node,\\n      getNode,\\n      basePath: \"data/faqs/\",\\n    })\\n\\n    // Creates new query\\'able field with name of \\'slug\\'\\n    createNodeField({\\n      node,\\n      name: \"slug\",\\n      value: `/faqs${relativeFilePath}`,\\n    })\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### createRemoteFileNode\\n\\nWhen building source plugins for remote data sources such as headless CMSs, their data will often link to files stored remotely that are often convenient to download so you can work with them locally.\\n\\nThe `createRemoteFileNode` helper makes it easy to download remote files and add them to your site\\'s GraphQL schema.\\n\\n```javascript\\ncreateRemoteFileNode({\\n  // The source url of the remote file\\n  url: `https://example.com/a-file.jpg`,\\n\\n  // The redux store which is passed to all Node APIs.\\n  store,\\n\\n  // Gatsby\\'s cache which the helper uses to check if the file has been downloaded already. It\\'s passed to all Node APIs.\\n  cache,\\n\\n  // The boundActionCreator used to create nodes\\n  createNode,\\n\\n  // OPTIONAL\\n  // Adds htaccess authentication to the download request if passed in.\\n  auth: { htaccess_user: `USER`, htaccess_pass: `PASSWORD` },\\n})\\n```\\n\\n#### Example usage\\n\\nThe following example is pulled from [gatsby-source-wordpress](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-source-wordpress). Downloaded files are created as `File` nodes and then linked to the WordPress Media node, so it can be queried both as a regular `File` node and from the `localFile` field in the Media node.\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst { createRemoteFileNode } = require(`gatsby-source-filesystem`)\\n\\nexports.downloadMediaFiles = ({ nodes, store, cache, createNode, _auth }) => {\\n  nodes.map(async node => {\\n    let fileNode\\n    // Ensures we are only processing Media Files\\n    // `wordpress__wp_media` is the media file type name for Wordpress\\n    if (node.__type === `wordpress__wp_media`) {\\n      try {\\n        fileNode = await createRemoteFileNode({\\n          url: node.source_url,\\n          store,\\n          cache,\\n          createNode,\\n          auth: _auth,\\n        })\\n      } catch (e) {\\n        // Ignore\\n      }\\n    }\\n\\n    // Adds a field `localFile` to the node\\n    // ___NODE appendix tells Gatsby that this field will link to another node\\n    if (fileNode) {\\n      node.localFile___NODE = fileNode.id\\n    }\\n  })\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe file node can then be queried using GraphQL. See an example of this in the [gatsby-source-wordpress README](/packages/gatsby-source-wordpress/#image-processing) where downloaded images are queried using [gatsby-transformer-sharp](/packages/gatsby-transformer-sharp/) to use in the component [gatsby-image](/packages/gatsby-image/).\\n'},\n",
