# Classification of Programming Languages Used by GitHub Repo

## Introduction
For this project, we will be scraping data from Github repository README files and build a model that can predict what programming language a repository is using, given the text of the README file. The deliverables are:<br>
    - A well documented jupyter notebook that contains our analysis.<br>
    - Google slides that summarize our findings.<br>

## Goals
To predict the programming language used in a repository, based on the text of its README file.<br>

## Key Findings and Takeaways
